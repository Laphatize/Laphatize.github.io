  Are you paying attention or in a rush to play that game you wanted me to "hack" buddy? Probably not so let me just explain everything that's going to happen today.
  I'm going to pretend to send Lizzy a message as you saying you asked her to go to homecoming. I am also going to send a security message to everyone you have in your contacts lists that you have an insecure account that has been hacked and should not be trusted.
