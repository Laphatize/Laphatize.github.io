	<h3 style="margin-bottom:0%;"> Ellie - a multi-purpose bot made for Discord. <span class="label" style="background-color:green;">stable</span></h3>
	<p1 style="margin-top:0%;"> Discord is a pretty solid communication platform for gamers. However, sometimes things get tedious. There might be a pretty fiesty conversation involving 100's of messages that need to be deleted. Since, Discord doesn't have a mass delete button, it's up to you to delete them one-by-one. Ellie can take care of this for you with just one command. Want to play some music in the autochat? Just ask Ellie! Need to quickly kick a toxic friend? Just ask Ellie! <a href="https://elliebot.xyz">https://elliebot.xyz</a></p1>
